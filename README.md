# Become a Software Professional 2023

## **_Week 01_**

The first week we started working in groups on the Figma platform. My group was composed of three members and we had to make the trainer screens.
**[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/wrAYDVuRhM1UHELlsuYkGI/BaSP-2023-MEGAROCKET-Baru?node-id=701-367&t=hiN0CoblD3jo8rvu-0)**

## **_Week 02_**

In week two we started working with html, but using the structure we created in Figma in week one. We must emulate the Landing Page together with the Menu,
but only using pure html and respecting the semantics of it.

## **_Week 03_**

In this week we must first correct the errors marked by tutors from week two. Once we have the code fixed we will start working on our css adding it to our html. It should look similar to the figma landing page from week one.

## **_Week 04_**

In week 4 of the bootcamp we will have to apply flexbox inside our css to make our html responsive. Starting with mobile first and making it display correctly on all screens.

## **_Week 07_**

In the second week of stage two, we must implement fetch function to the singup and login using an api to confirm the data. The singup information is being stored in the local storage to keep the data in case we refresh the web.
