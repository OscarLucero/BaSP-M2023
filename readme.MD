# Become a Software Professional 2023

### ***Week 01***
The first week we started working in groups on the Figma platform. My group was composed of three members and we had to make the trainer screens.
**[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/wrAYDVuRhM1UHELlsuYkGI/BaSP-2023-MEGAROCKET-Baru?node-id=701-367&t=hiN0CoblD3jo8rvu-0)**

### ***Week 02***
In week two we started working with html, but using the structure we created in Figma in week one. We must emulate the Landing Page together with the Menu,
but only using pure html and respecting the semantics of it.

### ***Week 03***
In this week we must first correct the errors marked by tutors from week two. Once we have the code fixed we will start working on our css adding it to our html. It should look similar to the figma landing page from week one.

### ***Project***
The project is about creating a website about a gym (MegaRocket) where from 0 and during sixteen weeks we will be learning fullstack development. Every week we will have different statements where we will advance in the creation of this website.
